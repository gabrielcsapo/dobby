# What is this?

Dobby is an abstraction of cocoa widgets into a python setting.

# What is the purpose?

The purpose of this library is to rapidly produce osx native applications without the need for xcode or objective-c programming. All cocoa widgets are avaible with all event functionality and style just as in the cocoa documentation, but abstracted into a python space.

## Current Widgets

- Button = NSButton
- Dialog = NSDialog
- Label = NSLabel
- Icon = NSIcon
- Image = NSImage
- TextField = NSTextField
- Progressbar = NSProgressbar
- ScrollView = NSScrollView
- SplitView = NSSplitView
- StatusBar = NSStatusBar
- TabContainer = NSTabContainer
- TableView = NSTableView
- TextInput = NSTextInput
- TextView = NSTextView
- TreeView = NSOutlineView
- View = NSView
- WebView = NSWebView
